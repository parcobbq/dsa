			<p>Little Five Points (also L5P or LFP or Little Five or Lil' Five) is a district on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, 2 1‚ÅÑ2 miles (4.0 km) east of downtown. It was established in the early 20th century as the commercial district for the adjacent Inman Park and Candler Park neighborhoods, and has since become famous for the alternative culture it brings to Atlanta. It has been described as Atlanta's version of Haight-Ashbury, a melting pot of sub-cultures, and the Bohemian center of the Southern United States.</p>
